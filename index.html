<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Yan Yan</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Urban Planning and Geographic Analysis!</h2>
  <h3>I'm a junior here at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Urban Planning and minoring in GSWS. This is my first time taking a writing and web design course in college, other semesters typically consisting of GIS and urban studies courses. I originally planned on studying architecture, but personally found that working with people in urban spaces was more fulfilling. Having learned about design in urban spaces, buildings, and even maps, it'll be cool to see how design affects the field of writing and digital communication.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I grew up dabbling in all sorts of visual arts from painting to photography. I took a web design course in high school, which is what sparked my interest in digital art and design, which is my primary medium now. But my experience with digital art is largely controlled by what I know about traditional art, so the more technical stuff escapes me. In taking this course, I hope to expand on my little knowledge of the technical side of digital media.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>Good design understands its audience, is accessible, and maintains artistic authenticity. Audience and accessibility tend to go hand in hand. Designers that understand their audience know what visuals to use in order to appeal to the people that they want to. Without this aspect, design doesn't appeal to viewers, which is largely its job. Accessibility is similar, but takes it a step further with expanding the audience. Accessibility not only makes the design objectvely attainable for a designer's audience, but it extends a hand to those outside of the core audience, simply by making a design comprehensible. The final pillar is authenticity, which just means that good design is done with the right designer. Someone who is comfortable and happy with what they were tasked to do. Everyone has different tastes, so "good design" is going to be different depending on who's working on it.</h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path?

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>I hope to pursue something in the urban planning field in the future, planner or otherwise. Urban planners design spaces and work with clients to do so, much like the work of many designers. People who work with GIS literally work with digital design in order to create maps. I feel that no matter what field, digital design and writing is always going to have some sort of impact because it acts as a bridge of communication when words can't do the trick. </h3>
